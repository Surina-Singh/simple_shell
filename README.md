# **A Simple Shell Recreation**

## Introduction

This is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates the **sh** program on Linux. Once installed our shell will display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command that always ends with a new line. The prompt will always be displayed after a command has been executed in order to make user experience easy. If the command cannot be executed, print error will be displayed in the terminal and the prompt will be displayed again.
